			<h1>Mapping</h1>
			<h4>The Mapping plugin provides offline mapping functionality to geographically visualize data on a map.</h4>
			
			<img border="0" src="img/mapping-main.jpg" vspace="5">
			<h2>What can I do with the Mapping?</h2>
			<h3>
				Mapping offers a powerful way to visualize Forms, TextForms and SMS messages according to the sender's default location, 
				or to synchronize with an Ushahidi deployment to allow both viewing and creation of incident reports offline.
				The plugin can also turn any received SMS message into an Ushahidi incident report and uploaded once an internet 
				connection becomes available.
			</h3>
			
			<h3>
				Note, the Mapping plugin requires some familiarity with the Ushahidi platform. 
				You may therefore want to find out more about Ushahidi and what it's about from the	
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi website</a>.
			</h3>
			
			<h2>Activating the Mapping plugin</h2>
			<h3>
				When FrontlineSMS is installed for the first time, the Mapping module is initially hidden from view. 
				To activate the Mapping module, go to the View menu, then select Tabs, and make sure "Mapping" is ticked. 
				A new Mapping tab should then appear with your other menus along the top of the screen. 
				To hide the Forms module, go back into the same menu and remove the tick/check from the "Mapping" entry.
			</h3>
			
			<h2>Mapping Setup</h2>
			<h3>
				The Mapping Setup dialog provides options for the four main components: Mapping, Ushahidi, Forms and TextForms.
