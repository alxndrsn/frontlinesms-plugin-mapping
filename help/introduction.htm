      is the first text messaging system to be conceived, designed and written 
      firmly with the needs of the non-profit sector in mind. Until now, the 
      majority of systems have not taken into account the nature of non-profit 
      work, and the specific conditions (financial and physical) which many NGOs 
      work under. The FrontlineSMS software is provided <b>free</b> to charities 
      and other non-profit organisations. FrontlineSMS has been successfully 
      deployed in over forty countries in many areas by grassroots NGOs 
      including the Nigerian and Philippine elections, in the sending of 
      security alerts to fieldworkers in Afghanistan, market prices to 
      smallholder farmers in Aceh, and to circumvent government restrictions in 
      countries including Zimbabwe and Pakistan</font></p>
      <p align="left"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">In short, FrontlineSMS 
      turns a laptop - or desktop - computer and a mobile phone or modem into a 
      two-way group messaging hub (see image, above). Since it works anywhere 
      there's a mobile signal, it doesn't need the Internet, a major advantage 
      for many grassroots NGOs</font></i></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#666666" face="Arial" size="2">The 
      FrontlineSMS success story has been cited in numerous NGO and industry 
      research papers, websites, news sites and publications since its launch in 
      2005. It was short listed in the Mobile Messaging Awards 2007, named WSIS 
      &quot;ICT Success Story of the Month&quot; for its use in monitoring the Nigerian 
      elections, was a finalist in the Stockholm Challenge 2008 and was 
      nominated for a Tech Award in early 2008</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#666666">
      <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">In the 
      first two years since its release, FrontlineSMS has been used by NGOs for a wide range of activities including blood donor 
      recruitment and assisting human rights workers, to promoting government 
      accountability, keeping medical students informed about education options, 
      providing security alerts to field workers, election monitoring, the 
      capture and exchange of vegetable (and coffee) price information, the 
      distribution of weather forecasts, the co-ordination of healthcare 
      workers, the organising of political demonstrations, the carrying out of 
      surveys and the reporting and monitoring of disease outbreaks</span></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#666666">Are you a locally- or 
      internationally-based NGO looking at the potential to use mobile phone

      competition, or carry out a text-based survey? Or to simply keep in touch 
      with your fieldworkers or staff?</font></p>

      Who is behind FrontlineSMS?</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#666666">The FrontlineSMS concept 
      was developed by <b> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kiwanja.net">
      <font color="#800000">kiwanja.net</font></a></b> in early 2005, and the first 
      version released later in the same year. Since 2003, kiwanja.net has been 
      helping local, national and international non-profit organisations make 
      better use of information and communications technology in their work. 
      Specialising in the application of mobile technology, it provides a wide 
      range of ICT-related services drawing on over 22 years experience of its 
      founder, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kiwanja.net/kenbanks.htm">

      <font color="#800000">Hewlett Foundation</font></a> provided further 
      funding - to continue research and development - at the beginning of 2009. Programming and software development was carried out by 
      Alex, Ben, Kadu and Tom at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masabi.com">
      <font color="#800000">Masabi</font></a>, and the FrontlineSMS website was
